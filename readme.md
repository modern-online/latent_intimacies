# <em>Latent Intimacies</em>
### Medialab Matadero : Prototyping Lab 03 : Synthetic Minds 

What is a “latent intimacy”? Where do we catch glimpses of intimacy in today’s human-machine interactions? And what else could intimacy be? A latent intimacy is, for us, a gesture to AI’s potential to propose alternative forms of intimacy, echoing semantic accidents captured in earlier, more primitive human-machine interactions. 

In Latent Intimacies, we used interviews, observation, and prototyping to produce three Études Brut, “studies in rawness”, refracting what we thought we knew about intimacy through three specific speech synthesis and customised generative language models. The industrial form of these studies reflects neither purpose nor clear functional application, but they are ‘not mere accidents, waypoints on the way to something else.’ (Bogost, 2012: 93) They are here, they work, and therefore they are possible. 

What else could AI be? We approached the language model as a minor technology, detached from scalar norms of efficiency and optimisation. (Anderson and Cox, 2023; Fartan, 2023) These raw studies are small-scale, contrarian technologies, standing apart from the dominant narratives of technology and innovation. Our three prototypes have little commercial value, but they provide alternative routes into the digital world, promising slower, more considered connections than those currently offered by cloud-based AI platforms.
