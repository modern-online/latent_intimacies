# <em>Latent Intimacies</em>

What is a “latent intimacy”? Where do we catch glimpses of intimacy in today’s human-machine interactions? And what else could intimacy be? A latent intimacy is, for us, a gesture to AI’s potential to propose alternative forms of intimacy, echoing semantic accidents captured in earlier, more primitive human-machine interactions. 

In Latent Intimacies, we used interviews, observation, and prototyping to produce three Études Brut, “studies in rawness”, refracting what we thought we knew about intimacy through three specific speech synthesis and customised generative language models. The industrial form of these studies reflects neither purpose nor clear functional application, but they are ‘not mere accidents, waypoints on the way to something else.’ (Bogost, 2012: 93) They are here, they work, and therefore they are possible. 

What else could AI be? We approached the language model as a minor technology, detached from scalar norms of efficiency and optimisation. (Anderson and Cox, 2023; Fartan, 2023) These raw studies are small-scale, contrarian technologies, standing apart from the dominant narratives of technology and innovation. Our three prototypes have little commercial value, but they provide alternative routes into the digital world, promising slower, more considered connections than those currently offered by cloud-based AI platforms.

### Study #1: <em>Demolition</em>
##### Intimacy through vulnerability, the capacity to be damaged or harmed.

Our first study, <em>Demolition</em>, is site-specific, a block of concrete encapsulating half a dozen WhatsApp chats, our online interactions with those friends and family members who agreed to take part. We can ask anything we want, and the voice agent will try to give the best possible answer, by sampling text from this tiny, intimate dataset. It will then ask us to judge if its answer is relevant.

Emotions become embedded in latent space. Residue and resonance of past performances of generosity, care, and intimacy echo in the chambers of everyday life.

“I invite you to take a part of me.”

Using automation to erase unfavourable memories of past experiences liberates us from the fangs of yesterday. Confronting textual snippets of the past, stripped from their original context, can supply catharsis. At the same time, the interaction allows users to gauge and adjust their level of engagement, during the difficult process of mourning and moving on. 

Exit. Exist. Enter. Erase. Repeat.

### Study #2: <em>Red Book</em>
