# _Latent Intimacies_

_Latent Intimacies_ is a research-through-design project that uses open-source speech synthesis and generative language models to explore new forms of human-machine intimacy. Through three technical prototypes, we investigate how these technologies can evoke feelings of latency, vulnerability, and connection. Rather than chasing fluid, seamless interactions, the prototypes work with and build on existing technologies' constraints, using these to model alternative human-machine trajectories.

## Overview

What is a “latent intimacy”? Where do we catch glimpses of intimacy in today’s human-machine interactions? And what else could intimacy be? For us, latent intimacies gesture to AI's potential for alternative forms of intimacy. They echo the semantic accidents captured in earlier, more primitive human-machine interactions, the surprising, unintended meanings and non-sequiturs that hint at new possibilities for connection between humans and machines.

In _Latent Intimacies_, we used interviews, observation, and prototyping to produce three Études Brut, “studies in rawness”, refracting what we thought we knew about intimacy through three specific speech synthesis and customised generative language models. The raw, industrial forms of these studies witholds their purpose and functional application, but, at the same time, they are ‘not mere accidents, waypoints on the way to something else.’ (Bogost 2012: 93) They are here, they work, and therefore they are possible. 

What else could AI be? We approached the language model as a minor technology, detached from scalar norms of efficiency and optimisation (Anderson and Cox 2023; Fartan 2023). Open-ended, emergent, and nondeterministic, speech synthesis and generative language models enable fluid, unpredictable interactions that can challenge our assumptions about what's possible. These raw studies are small-scale experiments, embodying alternative trajectories for human-machine relations that stand apart from dominant narratives of AI as a universally capable, general-purpose technology. Rather than promising seamless integration or humanlike intelligence, the prototypes embrace constraints, frictions and detours, spotlighting the contingencies of specific human-AI configurations.


## Study #1: _Demolition_
### Intimacy through vulnerability, the capacity to be damaged or harmed.

![demolition](https://github.com/modern-online/latent_intimacies/blob/main/images/demolition.jpg)

Our first study, _Demolition_, is site-specific, a block of concrete encapsulating half a dozen WhatsApp chats, our online interactions with those friends and family members who agreed to take part. You can ask the voice agent anything you want, and it will try to supply the best possible answer, sampling text from this tiny, intimate dataset.

It will then ask you to judge if its answer is relevant.

> “I invite you to take a part of me.”

Using automation to erase memories of past experiences can liberate us from the fangs of yesterday. Revisiting prior interactions through _Demolition_'s constrained interface conjures flashes of past generosity, intimacy, and care – digital residues by turns gratifying and disconcerting. Textual snippets of the past, stripped from their original context, can supply catharsis. At the same time, the interaction allows users to calibrate their engagement, asserting their agency in the difficult process of mourning and moving on. 

Exit. Exist. Enter. Erase. Repeat.


## Study #2: _Red Book_
### Intimacy through protocol, a codified series of guidelines that facilitate orderly interaction, through a shared understanding of the rules of engagement. 

![redbook](https://github.com/modern-online/latent_intimacies/blob/main/images/red_book_new.jpg)

Inspired by a mystical social game played by Mexican children, _Red Book_ blends chance, prophecy, and divination. Playing the game requires a set of protocols for activation and engagement, while stressing the importance of disengagement; leaving without permission may have undesirable consequences.

The future is uncertain. People experience uncertainty as a source of discomfort and unease. It can leave them feeling vulnerable and precarious, threatening what they know of their place in the world. Given this, who do people turn to for answers, advice, guidance?

_Red Book_ is an actively curated language model, trained on a corpus of user-contributed texts. This enables any set of materials to become animated and agential, if still opaque. Stopping short of providing definitive answers, the recombined sources prompt dialogue, surfacing prompts for discussion and collective meaning-making.

A group looking for answers designates a spokesperson to address the Book, much as one would a voice-activated digital assistant. Once activated, the speaker delivers prompts and questions, interpreting the needs and interests of others in the group. Some questions linger, unanswered. As the interaction draws to a close, the speaker seeks permission to leave. 

> "Your presence is no longer required."


## Study #3: _Cats_
### Intimacy through latency, the delay between a cause and its effect.

![cats](https://github.com/modern-online/latent_intimacies/blob/main/images/cats.jpg)

This study intertwines the daily lives of cats, their caretakers, and the community. A tiny AI narrator, _Cats_ offers a unique perspective on the world. Translating snapshots from a cat-worn camera into basic spoken texts, the AI emulates a cat. It sticks around, but sets its own pace, providing pleasure, ungoverned, on its own terms.

_Cats_ takes an hour to load, and roughly 40 minutes to compute a text describing a randomly taken image. The AI outputs around ten images a day; ten short texts spoken aloud, captioning everyday moments seen through a cat’s eyes. We seek connection, closeness, and this device forces us to wait, tracking the low-maintenance intimacies of pet ownership. Cats have latency. Durations of absence are experienced when you go about your ordinary everyday life outside the home, leaving your furry friend alone during business hours. 

> “I saw a man sleeping on a bench in a grassy park.”

Other technologies promise to monitor our pets, but plug-and-play surveillance casts them as captives, not peers. Giving your cat a voice introduces an alternative context. _Cats_ casts the language model as a wearable minor technology. The prototype doesn't just entangle human, animal and machine, but purposefully obfuscates and reorders those categories. Its delayed transmissions demand patience. Rather than inundating users with a barrage of texts and images, _Cats_ yawns and stretches, relaxing into the interval between outputs.
