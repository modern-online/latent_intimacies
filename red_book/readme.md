## Red Book prototype code

Has been tested on Jetson Orin Nano 8GB Development Kit.

Please use red_book_jetson.py if running code on a Jetson, or if your computer has a discrete GPU. red_book.py was equally tested on MacBook Pro M1.

Supporting files (i.e. fixed audio interaction files) coming soon.
